# Spam-Email-Detection-with-Machine-Learning
In this project, we will be building an email spam detector using Python.
Spam mail, also known as junk mail, refers to emails sent to a large number
of users simultaneously, often containing deceptive messages, fraudulent
schemes, or potentially harmful phishing content. We will utilize machine
learning techniques to train our spam detector to accurately classify emails
as either spam or non-spam. By developing this detector, we aim to
enhance email security and protect users from falling victim to spam
emails.
